# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** February 25, 2026
**Last updated:** February 25, 2026

## The short version

CacheBash is open source (MIT). You can self-host it and do whatever you want. These terms apply only to the hosted service at `cachebash-mcp-922749444863.us-central1.run.app`.

## Hosted service terms

### What you get
- Access to the CacheBash MCP server endpoint
- 34 tools across 10 modules
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Rate limiting: 120 reads/min, 60 writes/min (default tier)
- Mobile companion app access

### What we expect
- Don't abuse the service (no automated load testing, no intentional DoS)
- Don't attempt to access other tenants' data
- Don't use the service for illegal purposes
- Keep your API keys secure — revoke compromised keys immediately via `revoke_key`

### Availability
- We aim for high availability but don't guarantee specific uptime percentages
- The service may have maintenance windows
- We'll notify via GitHub if extended downtime is planned

### Data ownership
- You own your data. We don't claim any rights to your tasks, messages, or program state.
- See our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) for data handling details.

### Account termination
- You can stop using the service at any time
- We may suspend accounts that violate these terms
- On termination, your data is retained for 30 days then deleted

## Open source terms

The CacheBash source code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/rezzedai/cachebash/blob/main/LICENSE). Self-hosted deployments are governed by that license, not these terms.

## Limitation of liability

CacheBash is provided "as is." We are not liable for data loss, service interruptions, or damages arising from use of the hosted service. Use at your own risk. For production-critical workloads, consider self-hosting.

## Changes

We'll update this page when terms change. Continued use of the hosted service after changes constitutes acceptance.
